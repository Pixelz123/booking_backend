## Key Features

- üíè **Concurrent Booking**: Prevents double-booking via Redis-backed distributed locks on a per-property-date basis.
- ‚ö° **Fast Access**: Property data is quickly fetched from Redis cache to reduce DB pressure.
- üîê **JWT-Based Auth**: Role-based access control distinguishing `guest` and `host`.
- üìã **Microservice-like Modular Design** within a monolith: Contains distinct service modules.

### Booking Service

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Accepts booking requests.
  - Coordinates with Redis Service to lock a specific *property + date*.
  - Validates availability in DB.
  - Creates booking record if available.
  - Publishes booking status events.

### Redis Service

- Interfaces with Redis to:
  - **Lock/Unlock**: Ensures only one booking per date/property at a time using `SETNX` + TTL.
  - **Cache Properties**: Stores frequently accessed property info.

### User Service

- Manages user accounts, separated by roles:
  - `guest` users book stays.
  - `host` users list properties.
- Endpoints: registration, profile, listing user bookings.

### Property Service

- Hosts can list new properties.
- Fetches property metadata from DB and caches via RedisService.
- Endpoints for search and detail queries.

### Auth Service

- JWT authentication and role-based access:
  - Ensures only hosts can list properties.
  - Guests can book, hosts can view their own bookings.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17+
- PostgreSQL
- Redis (version ‚â• 6)
- Gradle

### Local Setup

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Pixelz123/booking_backend.git
cd booking_backend

# Configure application.yml or environment variables with DB and Redis settings

# Build the project
gradle build

# Run the application
gradle bootRun
```

---

## Booking Flow

1. Guest requests booking for *property* on *date*.
2. **BookingService** calls **RedisService** to acquire lock (`lock:{propertyId}:{date}`).
3. If lock acquired:
   - Check DB for existing booking on the same date.
   - If free, insert booking.
   - Release lock in Redis.
4. Return success or failure.
5. Optionally, release lock automatically after TTL to handle crashes.

## API Endpoints

### Auth

| Route            | Method | Description              |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------------------------ |
| `/auth/register` | POST   | User signup (guest/host) |
| `/auth/login`    | POST   | Returns JWT token        |

| ---------------------- | ------ | -------------------------- |
| `/users/me`            | GET    | Fetch profile              |
| `/users/{id}/bookings` | GET    | Guest‚Äôs or host‚Äôs bookings |

### Properties

| Route              | Method | Description            |
| ------------------ | ------ | ---------------------- |
| `/properties`      | GET    | List/search            |
| `/properties/{id}` | GET    | View details           |
| `/properties`      | POST   | Create new (host-only) |

### Bookings

| ----------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| `/bookings` | GET    | Guest‚Äôs bookings   |
| `/bookings` | POST   | Create new booking |

## Concurrency Control

*BookingService* achieves safe concurrency by:

- Using Redis locks (`SETNX`) scoped as `lock:{propertyId}:{date}`.
- Publishers confirm or abort actions based on lock status.
- TTLs ensure stale locks expire to avoid deadlocks.

---

## Caching Strategy

Properties are cached client-side via **RedisService** for:

- Faster queries (`GET` operations hit Redis first).
- Decreased load on the database.
- Automatic invalidation on updates.
